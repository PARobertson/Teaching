# Quantum Boltzmann Distribution Visualizer

This is a interactive tool for exploring the Boltzmann distribution for quantum harmonic oscillators and rigid rotors. You get to pick a diatomic molecule (or add your own) and explore how the relative populations of the n and J states vary with temperature. It even calculates the partition function for you!

Full disclosure: I wrote the majority of this program using Claude.ai. If you're AI adverse, then you are (stronger than I am!) and free to enjoy doing these calculations by hand or read through the syntax to write your own program.

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. ## Install Python ##  (3.8 or newer) from [python.org](https://python.org)
   - âœ… Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. ## Install Packages ##
   Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and run:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy

3. ## Download and Run ## 

    Download Boltzmann_Simulator.py from this repository
    Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder you downloaded to and run:
   ```bash
   python Boltzmann_Simulator.py

5. ## Troubleshooting ##

    Most errors will arise from Python not being installed properly on your computer, or the environment not being configured/activated. 
    Google will solve these problems for you much faster than I can. 
    Best strategy is to copy the last line or two of error message you get when you try to run the program into your search engine of choice.
    Feel free to ask me if you get stuck, of course.
